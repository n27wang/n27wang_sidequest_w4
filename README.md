## Description

--- This project explores custom level design using a 2D grid system in p5.js. Instead of modifying the provided example, I designed original levels using a tile-based representation where numerical values define walls, floors, collectibles, and an exit. The project demonstrates how abstract data structures (arrays) can function as rule-based environments that shape player movement and progression.

## Learning Goals

--- Design original levels using a 2D array structure
Translate grid coordinates into screen space using tile-based rendering
Implement rule-based interactions (collision, collection, level progression)
Understand how data structures define environmental logic
Practice keeping game systems simple and readable

I used ChatGPT to help brainstorm how to structure multiple levels within a grid system and to clarify how tile values could represent different mechanics (walls, coins, exit, etc.). I reviewed, modified, and tested all generated suggestions to ensure they aligned with course requirements and my own understanding of grid-based systems.
